## Task 2: Data Exploration Phase (21.3.â€“20.4.)

When the annotation phase has finished, we will hand out the training data to you. Instead of blindly throwing that data at machine learning algorithms, a good data scientist will first do some exploratory data analysis. In your team, we would like you to analyze the data with respect to the following aspects:

1. How consistent are the emotion annotations? Do different annotators agree in their ratings of the same excerpt?

2. Derive discrete quadrant-based class labels from the raw annotations. Any ideas on how to aggregate conflicting annotations? Outliers?

3. How are the resulting discrete class labels distributed? Are the classes unbalanced, and how much? How are the features distributed? Are there any pairs or subsets of features that seem highly correlated or redundant?

4. How are GEMS9 and GEMMES related to arousal and valence?

5. Which features seem useful for classification? Which ones are correlated with the labels?

6. Any interesting conclusions you can draw from this for the next project phase?

For this, use any kind of statistical computation or visualization that you find enlightening. Compile your results into a report, in the form of a slide deck. Submit your report as a PDF on Moodle by April 20th. Selected groups will be asked to present their report in class on April 25th (as an honor, not as a punishment).
